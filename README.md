# Discord Customizations
A collection of themes, snippets of useful code, and other assortments.

The source Sass files are found in the src folders, while the CSS files are found in the dist folders. You will most likely want to use the theme.css file, but if not, the normal .css file is listed as well.

### ColoredChannels
Replaces the boring gray channel groups with easily distinguishable pastel-ish colored ones. To achieve the image on the right in the preview below, you simply need to edit the Sass file and change `$icon-colors-option: 'enabled';` to `$icon-colors-option: 'disable';` and recompile yourself.

*The concept and original 6 base colors are all used from the original ColoredChannels theme by [Qwerasd](https://github.com/qwerasd205). This is a recreation because the original broke.*
